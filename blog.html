            <h2>1) Finding jobs and internships based on their qualifications and skillsets.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">AI has helped to shrink the so-called “skills gap,” where there are not enough
                skilled workers to fill future job openings. With AI, employers can now analyze and match potential
                employees with the appropriate positions more efficiently.AI has helped students find more than 3,400
                jobs in sectors like retail, finance and technology. <br><br>

            <h2>2) Use of ai chatbots in course management system.</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 26px">AI chatbots are the new way of increasing engagement with the college courses.
                These chatbots are programmed to answer questions and provide feedback on assignments. They can also
                answer questions about course material and provide tutoring services.

                The use of AI chatbots in the course management system has been a boon for students. They can now
                interact with their teachers on a one-on-one basis, without having to wait in long queues or attend
                office hours.

                Chatbots can be a great way for colleges to reach out to their alumni, provide them with updates on the
                college and answer any questions they might have. Chatbots can also help colleges find potential donors
                or funders by providing them with information on how they can donate or contribute to the college. <br>


                example: superbot-indias first educational chatbot.

            <h2>3) ai driven guidance and support system for students.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">AI is a great driving force for students. It has the potential to help students
                find their strengths and weaknesses, and also provide them with guidance on which classes to take.

                An AI driven system can be used to provide personalized guidance and support for students. These systems
                can identify the student’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as suggest courses that they should take in
                order to improve their skillsets.

                AI driven guidance systems are a great way of providing support for students who are struggling with
                college-related decisions. These systems can also help identify a student's strengths and weaknesses
                when it comes to picking out which classes they should take in order to achieve their goals.

            <h2>4)Can accsess mental health using NLP.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">AI has also led to improvements in clinical assessment for at-risk individuals.
                One such application is suicide risk assessment based on natural language processing. This involves
                using NLP to analyze user input in order to identify potential suicide risks. This allows healthcare
                professionals to provide vulnerable individuals with crisis support and assistance with distress
                management early in their illness process- creating opportunities for earlier intervention and pathways
                of care for vulnerable youth.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">
                AI is helping students in India with their studies, personal lives and career.

                India is a country where the education system has not been able to keep up with the growing demand for
                skilled labor. The government has been struggling to provide quality education to its citizens. AI can
                help solve this problem by assisting students with their studies, personal lives and career.
